## Knights and Knaves puzzle

The Knights and Knaves puzzle is a logic game where characters are either **Knights**, who always tell the truth, or **Knaves**, who always lie. The goal is to determine the identity of each character based on their statements.

This implementation solves the following puzzles:

- **Puzzle 0** contains a single character, A.  
  - A says “I am both a knight and a knave.”

- **Puzzle 1** has two characters: A and B.  
  - A says “We are both knaves.”  
  - B says nothing.

- **Puzzle 2** has two characters: A and B.  
  - A says “We are the same kind.”  
  - B says “We are of different kinds.”

- **Puzzle 3** has three characters: A, B, and C.  
  - A says either “I am a knight.” or “I am a knave.”, but you don’t know which.  
  - B says “A said ‘I am a knave.’”  
  - B then says “C is a knave.”  
  - C says “A is a knight.”
